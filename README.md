Personal Portfolio for a Fresh Graduate

I aim to showcase myself through this portfolio, which is divided into five sections: Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact.

The Home section includes my name, a brief introduction, and a photo of myself.

The About section provides information about me, including my skills, projects, and educational background.

The Skills section lists the programming languages I am proficient in, such as SQL, Python, and HTML.

The Portfolio section displays my works, including mini projects I have completed.

The Contact section contains my contact information, social media links, a contact form, and the option to download my resume. Lastly, there is a copyright section.

If you have any questions, suggestions, feedback, or comments, please feel free to reach out to me.
